PCT (Progress Compilation Tools) is a set of [Ant](http://ant.apache.org) tasks, designed to automate work in [OpenEdge](https://www.progress.com/openedge) environment.

PCT is distributed under the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

This project was born due to the lack of automated OpenEdge code compiler. PCT is a command-line based tool, so it can be run in batch mode, to generate nightly builds or for continuous integration. However, as PCT is a set of ANT tasks, your compilation tasks can be run using a graphical frontend to ANT.

PCT was designed and written by Gilles QUERRET (g.querret at gmail.com), freelance developer for [Riverside Software](http://riverside-software.fr) in France.
